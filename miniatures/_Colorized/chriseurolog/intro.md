Colourised minis from chriseurolog. Created using AI, yes I know, but I am no artist but wanted to share what I have been creating for my own games, all on PF2e but most will be generic adventurers or NPCs/monsters that will work in any similar fantasy world. All are self-generated using a combination of ComfyUI (local) and MeshyAI for the 3D models at the moment, under a premium licence so copyright is owned by me.
